Influenza Code: A Bio-Inspired Cybersecurity Framework Based on Epidemiological and Immune System Principles

Modern cybersecurity defenses remain largely static, signature-driven, and reactive, leaving them ill-equipped to counter rapidly evolving cyber threats such as ransomware campaigns, advanced persistent threats (APTs), and large-scale network worms. This paper introduces Influenza Code Cybersecurity, a novel adaptive defense framework inspired by biological immune systems and influenza virus evolution. By modeling cyber threats as evolving pathogens and security mechanisms as immune responses, the system transforms cybersecurity from a static perimeter defense into a dynamic, self-adapting ecosystem.

The framework integrates four core biological principles: (1) antigenic drift and shift to model continuous mutation and recombination of cyber threats, (2) a hierarchical immune system architecture combining innate, adaptive, and memory-based defenses, (3) epidemiological network modeling using reproduction number (R₀), herd immunity thresholds, and superspreader identification to quantify and contain threat propagation, and (4) co-evolutionary simulation grounded in evolutionary game theory to train defensive strategies against continuously adapting adversaries.

Implemented as a modular, cloud-native platform with real-time simulation, automated response, and explainable metrics, Influenza Code enables continuous learning from attacks rather than periodic signature updates. Experimental evaluations across simulated enterprise, cloud, and critical-infrastructure networks demonstrate significant improvements in zero-day detection latency, containment effectiveness, and false-positive reduction compared to traditional security approaches. The results suggest that epidemiological and immunological models provide a scalable and scientifically grounded foundation for next-generation cybersecurity.

This work positions cybersecurity as a form of digital public health, where resilience emerges through adaptive coverage, collective defense, and continuous evolution rather than static protection.
